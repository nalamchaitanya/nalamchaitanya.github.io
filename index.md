I am currently a PhD student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am fortunate to be advised by Thatchaphol Saranurak, Seth Pettie. I gratuated with Masters from Rutgers University, New Brunswick where I was advised by Sepehr Assadi. I completed my undergrad from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras where I was advised by Pandu Rangan Chandrasekaran. I am grateful to all my teachers because of whom I am in this position today.

My research interests are Graph Algorithms and Sublinear Algorithms.
